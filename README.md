# UX for Agentic Systems

_Design heuristics for building trustworthy, human-centered interfaces in systems that act on our behalf._

---

## 🌐 What is this?

This is a living framework of 13 heuristics for designing agentic systems—tools and interfaces where users delegate tasks to AI agents that can act autonomously or semi-autonomously.

As software shifts from passive interfaces to active collaborators, we need new UX principles to support delegation, transparency, explainability, and trust. This repo offers a structured set of rules, examples, and design implications for creating better human-agent interactions.

## 📚 Heuristics

Each heuristic includes:

- A **rule** – a guiding design principle
- **Why it matters** – the user need or trust gap it addresses
- **Design implications** – how it applies in product
- A **real or fictional example** – to ground the idea

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Agentic systems are no longer speculative—they're already here. If we don’t design intentional patterns around delegation, memory, and autonomy, the market will define them by accident.

This framework helps teams build systems that users can:
- Confidently **delegate** to
- Clearly **understand**
- And meaningfully **stay in the loop** with

## 🛠 Who This Is For

- Product & UX designers building AI-driven tools
- PMs and founders designing agent-powered workflows
- Researchers exploring the future of human-agent collaboration
